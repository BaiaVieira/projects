# CardioRemote

## Introduction

We are building a TV remote with embedded Electrocardiogram(ECG) and Photoplethismography(PPG) sensors to measure your heart rate,
oxigen saturation and blood pressure.

## Description

Imagine you no longer have to measure your blood pressure with those inflating things aka sphygmomanometer! 
Recent research as shown that with only ECG and PPG sensors we are able to get accurate readings of blood pressure.
We are developing a TV remote controller with embedded sensors so that everytime you grab your remote it will measure:
* heart rate
* oxigen saturation
* blood pressure

But why is this important?
There is a disease called Heart failure (HF) which is considered one of the major public health problems of the 21st century. 
One of the main ways to prevent this disease is by regularly measuring blood pressure and weight. With our remote we want to make
it easier and less intrusive the way people monitor this disease.
The audience


The technology used in this project includes:

* ECG sensor
* PPG sensor
* PCB with ARM controller, ADC to acquire the signals and Bluetooth

SOFTWARE
* Python (back-end)
* HTML5, CSS and JS (front-end)
* SolidWorks (to draw 3D of remote controller)
