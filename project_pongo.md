# Pongo

## Introduction

Pongo is a GPS based game, inspired on pong. With a smartphone, a group of users has run through a real map in search of the ball to play it and score. The map is previously define and can be a block, city, region, etc. 

## Description

This project is a game, that should be played with the smartphone. The users have to change the direction of the ball and make it leave the game area on the opposing side.

Using smartphone the game creator chooses the field on the world map and kick starts the game. The ball starts rolling and players have to move in the real world to play. The players that makes the ball leave more times wins the game.

The intended audience is all the people that like games that interact with the real world.

For this prototype built during the pixels.camp hackathon, we will develop a native Android app and server component (built using node.js). For the communication we are still evaluating some alternatives, but it will most certainly be done using Ably.io.
