# Pixels Camp Challenge

The goal of the Pixels Camp challenge is to single out and reward creativity and innovation by providing participants with an opportunity to work together within a time frame of 48 hours to create something awesome.

## Eligibility

Any Pixels Camp approved participant can apply, as long as they are on the premises during those 48 hours (within reason – you are allowed to go out and get some air, sleep in a proper bed if you want to, etc.)

Groups must up to 3 elements, all of whom must be Pixels Camp participants. Teams are advised to recruit elements with a wide diversity of interests that complement each other in their knowledge areas. The broader the skills in a team, the higher the probabilities to surprise the public and the jury with innovative ideas.

### Participants can only join one project at a time.

Ideas, concepts, and team organization are tasks that can be thought out before the event but the project itself should be developed during the 48 hour period. Although monitoring this is nearly impossible, the jury and other members will be actively looking for proof that the team has worked and developed their ideas on the site.

## Schedule

The programming event will last exactly 48 hours, starting on the first day. You can see the full schedule [here][1].

## Project Registration

To participate, you have to register your project online. The instructions to do this will be released soon. This is mandatory and should be done as soon as you enter Pixels Camp. The deadline is on the second day until 2pm.

Any submissions without records will be discarded and will not be considered during pre-selection.

Don’t take this lightly! You should be as accurate as possible. A bad project description is a handicap you don’t want to have.

## Selection Process

All projects will undergo a pre-selection process via video review. As soon as you have your team ready and a clear idea of what your project will do, you must shoot a small video that summarizes the whole concept, purpose, and technologies used.

The video can’t be longer than 150 seconds (that's 2m 30s), and you must follow these topics:

* What’s your project name and number
* What’s the audience? Who will be using it and why.
* How did the team meet? Met on Pixels Camp?
* What are your team tech skills?
* Did you start the project on Pixels Camp?
* Describe the project. Bonus points if you already have something to show.
* What technology did you use
* How close are you to finishing the project?
* Will you be able to finish it in time for the presentation?

We don't need a fancy video, don't waste time showing off your amazing video editing skills. A smartphone as a camera and good sound will do the trick. You can use whatever you want as long as you keep it within the 150s limit. Remember! The picture is important but the audio is probably more important at this stage.

The goal of this pre-selection is to determine which teams will go on the main stage, since the overall Pixels Camp schedule is very tight and on-stage presentations are limited to 2 hours, and thus it might be impossible to have everyone demo their project live.

Some projects may be called a second time for a live interview with the whole jury for further assessment.

## Presentation

Pre-selection results will be posted online at the Pixels Camp site and online tools at 11:00 on Saturday – we'll announce that posting primarily via Twitter and Slack, so make sure you're following @pixelscamp, and via our blog and other communication mechanisms we'll have on site.

The selected projects will be presented on stage by a single representative team member, who'll have 90 seconds to pitch and/or demo your project.

## Awards

After the presentations, the jury will bestow awards taking into consideration the following criteria:

* Public vote
* Degree of achievement
* Originality and creativity
* Technical competence
* Innovation
* Awesomeness

Good luck!
