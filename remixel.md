## Introduction

Remixel is the funniest way to mashup sounds. The combined sounds are then performed by an elite group of artists! In the end, Remixel makes it easy not only to create but also share it.

## Description

What Remixel does is make use of a sound database - [Soundy](soundy.top) - to enable *anyone* the creation of sound combinations. After the user selects the sounds, a stage appears and a bunch of pixelized characters perform the created sound combination.

In the end, a link is made available so that the user can share it.

For this, we are using React, Redux and Rails. We're making use of [Soundy](soundy.top) to get the sounds.
